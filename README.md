Making a STUPID website to pratice STUPID math for my STUPID school.

This will probably be limited to programs that can quiz only the simplest math skills: stuff from addition all the way up to quadratics.

IF THERE ARE ANY ARTISTICALY GIFTED PEOPLE PLEASE HELP ME WITH THE STYLING OF THE WEBSITE IT LOOKS LIKE CRAP BUT I WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE A GAMEBOY GAME THAAAAANKS
